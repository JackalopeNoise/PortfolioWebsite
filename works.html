				<img src="img/art1.gif" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Awake At Night</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: 6 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This piece is one that is very special for me, that's why I'm showcasing it first. As it was made in a very unique time of my life, and I still hold it in high regards. Made using Clip Studio Paint, drew over the sketch twice to get two different linearts that would change color and give it a bit of movement. One of my more abstract pieces as it was meant to represent a lot of my emotions at the time. </p>
			</div>

				<img src="img/art2.png" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Diamond Frost</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: ~4 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This piece is a combination of fanart, as the character is based off of an existing property, but also a test for my character design prowess, as I wanted to make him look unique despite being based off of something else. Made using clip studio paint, I usually like to keep my character art with a transparent background, but for design sheets I include a solid color background.</p>
			</div>	
		</div>
		
		<div id="picture3" class="gallery-lightbox">
			<div class="gallery-lightbox__content col-8">
			    <a href="#!" class="close"></a>
				<img src="img/art3.jpg" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Battle Stance</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: 8 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This one falls under a label of sketch, I wanted to test how much it would take me to sketch that big an amount of characters, as I usually limit myself to two characters, not to mention variety in body types and posing. I still really enjoy this piece as I think I captured the different character's attitudes. Also made with Clip Studio, this one required a lot of layers to make sure the lineart didn't get messed up, as well as the different phases of the sketch.</p>
			</div>

				<img src="img/art4.png" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Monica</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: ~5 hours </h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">One of my older works in here, but also one I made as a commission, one of my first instances of professional work as an illustrator, and I still enjoy the way it turned out despite being over a year old. For this one I actually used a different method of doing the lineart, as I wanted it to be a little more colorful. Turned out to be highly inconvenient but ultimately I got comfortable enough to do it consistently.</p>

				<img src="img/art5.jpg" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Neon Night</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: -4 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This one's a recent headshot I made as I wanted to test out this method of coloring and partially lineless artstyle. I really enjoy the final product, even if it is quite loud, color wise. But that was by design, so it did what I wanted it to do in the end. Also made with Clip Studio, and it was a relatively small amount of work considering it was something entirely new.</p>

				<img src="img/art6.png" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Jet Set Noise</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: 6 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This is my most recent work of the ones I picked out, it started off as a sketch to test making different outfits, and I ended up really liking this one so I lined and coloured it. I wanted it to look very colorful, but still well coordinated. Baggy clothing is some of my favorite to draw, as it can be quite visually interesting, if a little strange. The roller blades were an inspiration from the game Jet Set Radio, hence the title of the piece. This one did take quite a while as I was using a few different tools and brushes I wasn't so used to, but I love the end result.</p>

		<div id="picture7" class="gallery-lightbox">

			    <a href="#!" class="close"></a>
				<img src="img/art7.png" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Okay</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: 3 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This is probably my oldest piece here, but it is a very important piece to me as it was the first where I actually started to notice a drastic change in my art-style and the way how I approached drawing certain things, and it pushed me to keep going further with illustration. Simply an okay hand sign, nothing overly complicated to say other than it looks cute.</p>
			</div>

		<div id="picture8" class="gallery-lightbox">
			<div class="gallery-lightbox__content col-8">
			    <a href="#!" class="close"></a>
				<img src="img/art8.gif" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">By Your Side</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: +6 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This is a hard one to explain without the context of what it was based on, but it simply is an RPG healthbar based on the game Omori. I was really inspired by the aesthetic of the game, with the child-like pencil illustrations and coloring. This one took quite a lot of work as I had to put together the frame from the actual images to appear on, as well as handling an unfamiliar art-style and changing a lot of things between expressions. But to this day it is still one of my favorite pieces I have ever drawn. </p>

			    <a href="#!" class="close"></a>
				<img src="img/art9.png" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Swatch</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: 3 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This one is pretty simple, it's just meant to be fanart of a character whose design I really like, from the game Deltarune by Toby Fox. It was a relatively spontaneous drawing as I really didn't have to put that much thought into it. The more complicated part was the background, since I was kind of just guessing at how the rose should look, but I like how it turned out.</p>

				<img src="img/art10.png" alt="">
			    <h2 class="art-title">Underclock</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Time: 6 hours</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This one's less of a whole piece and more a character design I had had in mind for a long while, an evil scientist part machine part animal. It's always fun to see an idea you've had stuck in head come to life, even if it did take a while as I'm still inexperienced with machines and metal.</p>

			    <h2 class="art-title">Photography: Movement</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Date: 28 November 2020</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">The next few entries are from my photography assigment for university. My experience with a camera is still relatively on the beginner side so these are mostly of the experimentation type. This one being mostly about trying to catch the movement of a car.
				It took quite a few tries but eventually I got a good shot that showcased the speed relatively well.</p>

			    <h2 class="art-title">Portrait</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Date: 2 December 2020</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This one was the portrait submission. We went around trying to find good spots with good lighting to take the picture, I ended up liking this one the most as it looked pretty natural.</p>

		<div id="photo3" class="gallery-lightbox">

				<h4 class="art-info">Date: 4 December 2020</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This one was another big experimental one, using the a slow shutter speed in the dark to get a lighttrail from the wands. It took quite a few tries to get a good looking one.</p>

		<div id="photo4" class="gallery-lightbox">

			    <h2 class="art-title">Flower Focus</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Date: November 3 2020</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This is my favorite out of the pictures I took for the portfolio, flowers are a favorite subject of mine, and this was the first flower I got to see on my first day in the UK. I edited some, adding a slight color effect over it, and playing with some of the lighting.</p>

			    <h2 class="art-title">Night Alley</h2>
				<h4 class="art-info">Picture edited to include 3D elements</h4>
			    <p class="art-decription" style="padding-bottom: 3rem;">This picture includes 4 different 3D models made from scratch, with rendered lighting so they look as natural as possible within it. The benches, cups, traffic cones and wheels were all modeled by me. It's quite an interesting process to get the objects to mesh with the environment, even if the process is quite lenghty.</p>
